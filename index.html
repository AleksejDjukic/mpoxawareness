          <h2>History of MPOX , Epidemiology</h2>
          <p>
            Mpox is an infectious disease that is caused by infection with monkeypox virus (MPXV).
            Mpox was first discovered in 1958 when outbreaks of a pox-like disease occurred in monkeys kept for research. The first human case was recorded in 1970 in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), and since then the infection has been reported in a number of African countries. Prior to 2022 most cases were reported from the DRC and Nigeria.
            In 2003, mpox was recorded in the US when an outbreak occurred following the importation of rodents from Africa. Cases were reported in both humans and pet prairie dogs. All the human infections followed contact with an infected pet exposed to an imported animal and all patients recovered.
            There are 2 major genetic groups (clades) of MPXV, Clade I (formerly known as Central African or Congo basin clade) and Clade II (formerly known as West African clade). Clade I is split into Clade Ia and Clade Ib. Clade II is split into Clade IIb and Clade IIa, with subgroup clusters called lineages. The majority of the cases seen in the outbreak in 2022 were from Clade IIb, lineage B.1.
            Since May 2022, cases of human mpox have been reported in multiple countries that have not previously had MPXV in animal or human populations, including the UK. The majority of these cases are from Clade IIb, lineage B.1.
            Since January 2023, Clade II mpox is no longer considered a high consequence infectious disease (HCID) within the UK. Clade I mpox remains an HCID. There is further information on the HCID status of mpox available. Further information on the epidemiology of mpox is available in the mpox epidemiological overview.
